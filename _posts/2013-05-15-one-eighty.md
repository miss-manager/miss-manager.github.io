For many, the *One-Eighty* (180) is considered the trump card in the hand of an underperforming middle manager.

Used to maximum effect at times of high stress and confusion, it has been known to disorientate and disengage even the most aspirational and talented staff. This advanced management manoeuvre can simultaneously create both of the twin pillars of the disfunctional team: a lack of hope and an abundance of despair.

Practitioners of the art (traditionally graduates of the 'Headless Chicken' school of management) will be able to perform this handbrake turn of strategic direction (so that team objectives, priorities and vision are now pointing in exactly the reverse direction to those formerly held, understood and held in esteem) with the minimum of notice and a complete absence of explanation.

True Masters (Zen Chickens) will be observed to spin the steering wheel of life mid-situation (or if they are truly in the zone, mid-sentence).  This will ensure that team members will be sufficiently disorientated to blame themselves for never truly comprehending the goals of the project.  They will therefore not wish to expose themselves to group disapproval by raising tedious points of detail (e.g. last time we did this we lost $28,000).

*Gertie's Tip:*

The *One-Eighty* embraces one of my golden rules - "In all things, inconsistency".

Why not try selective 180's within the team, or at least a partial briefing approach, such that key players are 'out of the loop' with respect to the new team priorities. You may be pleasantly surprised, even if they aren't.
