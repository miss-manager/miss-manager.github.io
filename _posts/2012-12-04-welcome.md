<strong>Are you tired of high performers and members of your team needlessly showing initiative?</strong>

Middle Manager of the Month, Gertrude Belcher (Monmouthshire Council Workspace Transformation and Inclusivity Team, November 2003) shares her thoughts on how to turn aspirational go getters into broken men and women, making sure that YOU always shine as the least incompetent person on the floor, painlessly raising your own assessment grades to “adequate” as you truly stand out from the crowd.


Each month, Gertrude will explore key themes and practices, responding to fictitious easy questions in order to promulgate a number of strategies that are at best ill thought through, and at worst, in contravention of the Geneva Convention and/or Amnesty International.
