We all know there are only 24 hours in the day (couldn’t the ancient Egyptians get anything right?) so putting them to least effect is crucial.  Write down all the things you need to do in a list and then sort them into:

* Easy
* Hard
* Very hard
* Urgent
* Too late

Now you are getting somewhere. Starting with the easy tasks, see if you can stretch these out till lunchtime. If not, spend more time on your list.

After a good lunch, review the list with your team members - you may find that some tasks now don’t need doing at all (urgent → too late). At this point, the more conscientious members of your team will start to waiver at the prospect of very hard tasks becoming urgent.  As a leader, it is critical that you hold your nerve.  Never reprioritze tasks.

*Gertie’s Tip:*

Think of each second of the working day as a unique and perfect grain of sand. Then think of an hour glass. Then think of that grain of sand on a beach in Barbados. Then spend the remainder of the working day staring intently at your laptop screen whilst mentally allocating your remaining days of annual leave.
