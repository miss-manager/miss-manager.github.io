CURRICULUM VITALS FOR ARCHIBALD H-J
-----------------------------------

***

PERSONAL PROFILE

About six foot tall, in the morning. Star sign: Cancer, so I’m sensitive to the feelings of others, and have a vivid imagination, but I can also seem moody in stressful situations, especially around a Sagittarius. My shoe size is 9 UK (or 12 US/Canada),  but my feet are quite wide, so I struggle to find shoes in standard retailers such as Clarks.

***

ACADEMIC HISTORY

I was once described as “quite clever”, by my tutor, and at the precocious age of just 20, almost beat my younger brother at a game of chess. He is however, by his own admission, not very good.

By the age of 14, I could read. In English, mainly, but also in a language I made up in my head. It had only one vowel, "o", so difficult pronunciation was also a skill I got to grips with early.

EMPLOYMENT HISTORY

By the time my voice had dropped, I was out on the farmland as a beater in the hunt. I’m widely feared by pheasants and foxes near Bungay, Suffolk - a metropolis of commerce and culture. From these experiences, I’ve developed the skills necessary to use violence and loud shouting to resolve confrontation.

As soon as I could taste the difference between Adnams Southworld Bitter and Adnams Broadside, I’d spent three and a half weeks working on a worm farm, selecting only the juiciest and finest worms to be used as fishing bait. This allowed me to develop an appreciation for quality, technical agricultural practice, and the colour of a healthy worm.

Years later, I followed this up with a trip to Asia, where I taught literally millions of children the nuances of the English language. They called me “Shan Mu”, which means mountain berry. This name arose from an alcohol fuelled argument over the definition of a berry, in a bar in down town Shanghai. The observant linguist will notice that there is no similarity with my Christian forename, Archibald.

Finally, to continue my cultural diversification, I took a job in a steel factory, thirty seven minutes and fifteen seconds (on a road bike, mild headwind, no precipitation, mild cloud cover) away from my home, Any prospective employer should therefore note that I am comfortable with the harsh realities of commuting.
Here, I learned how keep up the appearance of work in front of factory supervisors, whilst contributing the *AM* (Absolute Minimum), towards efficiency and production.  I also learned to develop my considerable linguistic skills, and can count to seventeen, fluently, in Polish.

OTHER INTERESTS AND ABILITIES

As this CV shows, if you are looking for “average”, I’m not the candidate for you. If you’re looking for exceptional, look no further. 
My greatest strength is that I’m incredibly lucky.  This is evidenced by my Yahtzee record against my Grandmother: Wins 14 Losses 3 Draws 1.

I’m also a keen plastic explosives enthusiast.

OTHER EMPLOYMENT

Paper round, stretching from house 34, James Lane (reads The Telegraph), to 47, Aries way (reads The Sun, has a Doberman called Spike.)

Served copious quantities of Cointreau to the Bride at a wedding reception held at a local luxury establishment. Several conflicting reports still exist, but the consensus seems to be that she was later seen regurgitating her six course meal into the geraniums that adorn the drive way. I, however, take no responsibility for these events. She shouldn’t have asked for triples.

Worked as a tyre consultant in a Treadfirst Tyre Garage for three months, before legal complications arose regarding age of employment.

TOP REFEREES

**Howard Webb**. I’ve always felt that he was a little quick to hand out a first yellow, but his firm but fair approach to diving in and around the penalty area has won respect amongst fans and club management the world over.

**Sergio Pezzotta**. Never afraid of controversy, or intimidated by the big names in the dug outs, his favourite colour was red. He tended to feel that eleven men on each team made the beautiful game a little too crowded.

**Pierluigi Collina**. One of the games greatest. He made up for a lack of hair with an abundance of wisdom, and great people skills. His prominent eyeballs also gave him a physiological advantage over his colleagues, leaving many to question whether he was entirely human.

**Gertrude responds:**

*Dear Archie,*

*The key to a good CV is innovation, and your use of imagery, specifically images of football referees in a professional employment document, meets this criteria. However, although the use of initials in your name beneath the title engenders a sense of warmth and familiarity, for the purposes of a job application, a full name is considered more appropriate. I wish you the very best of luck in your employment search.*

*Kindest Regards,*

*Gertie*
