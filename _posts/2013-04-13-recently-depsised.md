*Dear Gertrude,*

*Recently I have become a team leader. I thought my friends at work would be pleased for me but now I find they all seem to really despise me.*
*I used to enjoy my work but now I simply dread going to the office.*
*The thing is, I have upgraded my Sky package so I don’t feel there is any going back. Can you suggest anything?*

*Yours,*

*R.D*

**Gertrude says:**

*Dear R.D.*

*Leadership is all about tough choices.  With Sky Movies continuously expanding their portfolio and Sky Sports bidding for fully exclusive F1 racing rights, there is a great deal to consider.   However, I suggest you pay heed to the robust wisdom of André Gide when making your decision:*

***"Il vaut mieux être détesté pour ce que vous êtes que d'être aimé pour ce que vous n'êtes pas."***

*or in English:*

***"It is better to be hated for who you are, than to be loved for not subscribing to expensive TV deals that others can ill afford".***

*Sincerest Regards,*

*Gertie*
