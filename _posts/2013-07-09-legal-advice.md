description:  Jealousy in the legal profession? Gertrude offers her unique perspective.
---

*Dear Gertrude,*

*I'm a trainee solicitor at a big city law firm. I'm used to being criticised (occasionally constructively) for the way I perform day to day administrative tasks and other menial projects. I feel that being the recipient of arbitrary and often unprompted abuse is a way I can add value, as it seems to de-stress my supervisor.* 

*However, recently she was so appalled with a piece of work that I submitted to her that she tore it to pieces... with her teeth. By which I mean she literally put it in her mouth and savaged it in front of me.*

*Is this an indictment of my performance, or should I view this as an opportunity? If the latter, can you recommend, for example, any meat-flavoured sprays that I can spritz on sheets of paper before I submit them?*

*Kind regards,*

*Jurisprovement*

**Gertie responds:**

*Dear Jurisprovement,*

*Do not misread these soft, empathetic signals from your supervisor.*
*Colouring of the cheeks, rapid breathing and bulging bloodshot eyes are recognisable signs of respect and affection, particularly in the legal profession.*

*Sadly, what lies at the heart of her behaviour is jealousy. She has recognised your upward trajectory and was so fearful of the fact that others would see the extent of your gift that she felt compelled to destroy the evidence of your talent by the only means possible, there not being a shredder immediately to hand.*

*Just to save time, however, for future work submissions I would recommend copper etchings until your relationship moves to the next level.*

*Sincerest Regards,*

*Gertie*
