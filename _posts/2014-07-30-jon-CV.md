*Dear Jon,*

*Too many job applicants overload their CV with excessive information.  I see that you have skillfully evaded this pitfall. By maintaining an element of mystery, you will entice a greater number of job offers.  However, perhaps you could be a little more forthcoming in the contact section.  Otherwise, you may find that you don't receive quite as many offers as your talent deserves.*

*Kindest Regards,*

*Gertie*
