description: Gertrude Belcher reviews a specialist technique for disorientating staff - the arbitrary reallocation of workstations.
---

Never underestimate the sense of well being and security that a workstation that is well lit, clean and central to the team area can convey to the highly motivated and empathetic team player.  The arbitrary reallocation of workstations (with minimal notice) can therefore be highly effective in disorientating staff.  To be most effective, the technique should only be applied to one or two individuals at any one time, thereby stimulating a number of anxiety generating thought patterns:

* Why me?
* Have I offended Tasha or Brian? 
* What does this mean for the future? 
* Arenâ€™t I worth more than this? (clearly not).  

For the accomplished manager, these questions should be left hanging.  This will serve to engender a broader sense of unease and uncertainty across the wider work group.  Immediately before Christmas is generally regarded as prime time for creating the *Heisenberg Atmosphere*, but quite a stir can be caused if the move takes place whilst the worker is away on leave.
