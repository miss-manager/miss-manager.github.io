Meetings form an essential component of the office routine.  For up-and-coming managers, they offer the chance to demonstrate good communication skills and sound judgement.  However, these opportunities do not come without risks.  Many a promising career has been derailed by a simple misunderstanding of the statement: “Does anyone have any questions?” 

This is not a question, but a statement.  In any management meeting (particularly those of a senior nature) it must be understood that the last thing the chairperson is expecting is anything other than a ringing endorsement of his/her ideas - "great","bang on","keep 'em coming" etc. 

To examine this further, we examine some of the questions (pitfalls) an unskilled manager might fall foul of:

* "How?" -  shows that insufficient attention has been paid to the unfolding brilliance of the chairperson’s project.
* ‘Why?’ -  demonstrates a lack of confidence in their infallible judgment.
* ‘When?’ - reveals a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the crisis that they have managed to concoct.

*Note: Any questions at all (even rhetorical ones) as lunch approaches is strictly verboten.*

There are exceptional circumstances in which one's hand is forced and a question must be asked late in the meeting.  In such cases, questions must be kept vague and ambiguous, leaving adequate wiggle room should the minutes ever be reviewed.
