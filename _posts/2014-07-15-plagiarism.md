*Dear Gertrude,*

*Over the last few months I have begun to notice that whenever I explain any of my ideas to my manager, it isn’t long before it becomes his idea.*

*In the past, it had always taken a couple of weeks before the idea reappears in the form of one his “deep revelations”.  Recently however, it seems that even during the course of one of our short conversations he is able to finish a sentence I have started before looking to me for endorsement and approval of his profound insight.  It’s starting to really get to me.*
 
*Am I really coming up with anything original or is my manager simply a great mentor, patiently allowing me to stumble upon truths that are obvious to him?  If the latter, why does he feel the need to immediately broadcast his "dazzling breakthroughs" to everyone in the office immediately afterwards?*

*Yours,*

*T.L*

Gertrude responds:

*Dear Theodopolis,*

*The deliberate replication and rebranding of ideas is a recognized industry technique for leading managers.  Remember, a good manager is always busy - he or she doesn't have time to waste on thinking.  Re-representation of ideas is an approach that I hold in the highest esteem (see Gertie’s golden rule: Why thinking can be dangerous).  Recognize that this is an opportunity to learn from the master and diversify your skill set. In time though, you may wish to feed him a few ideas that are less than brilliant.  You may be pleasantly surprised by the opportunities that follow.*

*Best wishes,*

*Gertie*
