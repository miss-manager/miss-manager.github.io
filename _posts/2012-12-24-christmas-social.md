title: The Christmas Social
---

The christmas social is an event that nobody wants to attend but cannot be avoided, much like one’s own funeral.

In spite of this, a poorly orchestrated gathering can be highly effective in sowing seeds of resentment and distrust between even the most effective of operational teams.

*Gertie's guidance:*

Unless someone obviously inept at organising events can be relied upon to destabilize proceedings, it is often best for the manager to get involved in the minutiae of such events.  This 'hands on' approach should continue right up until moments before the event is scheduled to take place.  At this point, the aspiring manager should deliver the carefully timed ‘hospital pass’ (see *Task allocation* for details) to an unsuspecting team member who is already organising Christmas lunch at home for twenty seven guests.

Part of the briefing should include an incomplete picture of who has paid their £10 deposit.  This should be followed by heavy sighing and grumbling about 'fussy' eaters with 'allergies'. Note: It essential that all details relating to allergies are kept vague.  One should never underestimate the ability of an ambulance arrival to inject some life into a dull evening.

In the context of a work social event, team members can usually be categorised as follows:

* Those that nobody wants to come.
* Those who are going to get absolutely schnitzelled and can therefore be relied upon to proffer several incriminating revelations regarding work and/or social misdemeanours that can be used against them in the future.
* Those who are going to cancel at the last minute and be quite ill tempered on the deposit refund issue.
* Those who did not want to come, resent spending the money, but driven by a desire not to be fatally undermined by their colleagues in front of their team leader have persuaded their partner to record CSI for the evening and turned up anyway.

Pre-dinner drinks, ideally starting at around 4pm, provide a forum for the manager to ‘show they are only human’ by sharing details about their planned skiing trip before leading the implicit criticism of those who are not coming.

Upon arrival at the restaurant (circa 9pm after some confusion over timings) the team should be feeling pretty reckless about spilling long term resentments over workstation allocation, terms and conditions and the apparently random nature of career progression in the organisation.

A long thin table next to some swinging doors or the toilets can usually be arranged.  The food should consist of two or three rather small portions of bland food, spread over three hours, before getting the drunkest person present to settle the bill and then attempt to divide the total equitably amongst guests such as Tasha (one glass of sparkling mineral water) and Brian, who has drunk the best part of four bottles of house wine and is now looking decidedly queasy.
