*Dear Gertrude,*

*I don't know if you remember me, we worked on the same floor at SMCC (I was in the gender awareness project team). I have been a little slow to get back into the swing of things at work after the break.  Do you have any suggestions for New Year's resolutions?*

*Yours,*

*Brian*

**Gertrude responds:**

*Dear Brian,*

*Yes I certainly remember you. Here are some resolutions that you may wish to consider:*

* I will buy a comb.
* I will look in the mirror before I leave the house.
* I will try not to look vacant for considerable periods of the working day.
* I will not allow my desk to resemble a collection point for the local food bank.
* I will not ogle Tasha while she uses the photocopier.

*Sincerest Regards,*

*Gertie*
