**Gertrude responds:**

*Dear Barry,*

*Thank you for your submission.  To my mind, this is a strong application.  The inclusion of what I presume is a nickname, 'the beast' in the title of your CV is unorthodox, but it makes you stand out from the crowd.  I wish you the best of luck in your career as a professional guidance counselor.*

*Kindest Regards,*

*Gertie*
